For the AI player, a function can be made that calculates the resulting position of ball, and the paddle automatically goes to that position, this saves the constant moving of the automatic paddle.
As of now, the game is endless, a function can be added that ends the game after one of the players gets 10 points, and a window pops up sayin, Player "winner" won.
